    <h1>History of Team Liquid</h1>

        <h2>Overview</h2>

        <p>Team Liquid is a professional team, founded in the Netherlands in 2000. Originally a Brood War clan, the team switched to SC2 during the SC2 Beta in 2010, and became one of the most successful foreign teams. On December 6, 2012, it was announced that the team had formed a Dota 2 division.

        <h2>Formation</h2>

        <p>The team's original incarnation has roots in a North American lineup headed by FLUFFNSTUFF called FIRE, that went on to represent compLexity Gaming at The International 2012. Following an early knockout, the coL squad disbanded with TC, ixmike88, and FLUFFNSTUFF moving over to Liquid and joining BuLba, who competed at TI2 with Evil Geniuses, and Korok, formerly of Quantic Gaming. </p>

        <p>In 2013 the team established itself as one of the premier North American organizations with this roster, placing highly in events such as the Raidcall D2L, The Defense, The Premier League, and the American Dota League in addition to securing an invite to The International 2013. After a rocky start they fell into the lower half of the bracket by a thin margin, which saw them defeat MUFC and then had one of their defining moments in a stellar performance against LGD.cn, knocking the Chinese behemoth out of the event. A loss to the defending champions Invictus Gaming saw them out in 7-8th place.</p>
